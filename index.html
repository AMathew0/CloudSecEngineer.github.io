  <h2>Welcome to My Cybersecurity Learning & Portfolio Site</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Ajeesh Mathai — an aspiring Cloud Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Engineer. This website is my personal learning space where I document my journey, hands-on experiments, study notes, and eventually real-world projects as I grow in the field of cloud security and infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this portfolio is to share what I'm learning, showcase practical labs and concepts, and build a solid foundation that can help others who are starting in cybersecurity, cloud technologies, or IT infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    🛠️ This site will evolve over time as I complete new labs, publish notes, and contribute projects.<br />
    📚 Feel free to explore the sections as they grow: <a href="labs/">Labs</a>, <a href="study-notes/">Notes</a>, <a href="projects/">Projects</a>, and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for visiting — whether you're here to learn, collaborate, or simply explore, you're welcome!
