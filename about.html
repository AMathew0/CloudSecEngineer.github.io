        Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm a passionate learner and aspiring <strong>Cloud Infrastructure & Cybersecurity Engineer</strong>.
        This portfolio is a living notebook â€” a place to share my hands-on learning, technical notes, personal labs, and real-world projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m currently following a 90-day self-learning roadmap to sharpen my skills in:
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud platforms â€“ AWS, Azure, GCP</li>
          <li>DevOps tools â€“ Git, Docker, CI/CD pipelines</li>
          <li>Security operations â€“ Firewalls, SIEM, incident response</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        This site is not only my career showcase but also a community resource. I hope it helps fellow learners, recruiters, and professionals alike.
